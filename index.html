                Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sofistication</em>, the
                seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
                everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
                knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical
                sofistication, probably more. To join our movement <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="https://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails
                    Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is
                part of the sample site for <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/css-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough CSS and
                        Layout to be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
                <strong>C</strong>ascading<strong>S</strong>tyle<strong>S</strong>heets, the language that allows web pages
                to be styled. Other related tutorials can be found at <a

        <h3>THE FOUNDERS</h3>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that
            the kind of technical sofistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <strong><em>at least a
                    billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

                        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen
                        Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines
                        of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
